1.1337 Still the Middle
 * Added pcat, a utility to dump the contents of packet capture files in a
   line-based, parsable format


0.1337 The Middle
 * Added PDF document creation (groff -> ps2pdf)

 * Added additional functionality to xor. This tool will be installed with
   several names to change its core action, while retaining its overall
   functionality. Currently, the following actions have been included:
   - xor
   - rot (bitwise rotate)
   - rol (bytewise rotate)
   - caesar (Caesar's cipher)

 * Added a summary man page (netre-tools.mdoc). This man page will be a sort of
   menu for users to find all of the tools included in the toolkit. Suggested
   by cashmoney.

 * In learning GNU autotools, the build cruft is now using libtool and creating
   a 'convenience' library out of pcap.c, which is used by the PCAP utils.

 * Added PCAP utilities from Zephyr's fluffy project. These utilities are small
   and fast. Instead of trying to cook up the proper command-line for tcpdump or
   tshark, one can use these simple utilities to slice, merge, and uniq PCAP
   files in the UNIX tradition. Additional time was spent to meet design goals
   as described below.

 * Modified all utilities to have a common command line interface with at least
   '-h' (usage/help) and '-v' (version).  My design goals are:
   - use a standard means of processing command line arguments (getopt)
   - have a solid main() that abstracts all notion of command line and arguments
     away from the main action of each utility
   - use a standard build toolkit (GNU autotools)

 * Zephyr's coding style is a bit different than mine, so I spent some time
   revising his code so that it aligns with my style (and maybe to be a jerk :)

 * hdng, a derivative of Zephyr's hd.c, was added. The idea was to maintain the
   excellent way hd.c chooses alternative glyphs so that the user may be more
   able to visually detect patterns in binary, while providing more options (all
   hex, all glyphs, and choosing the width of data to display on each line.

 * repr, named pyesc by Zephyr, was added in its renamed form.

 * Added utilities xor and unhex by Zephyr.
